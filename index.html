      <strong> Rajyam Party</strong><br>

Kalyan started his political career in 2008[63] as the president of Yuvarajyam,[64] the youth wing of Praja Rajyam Party which was started by his 
elder brother Chiranjeevi. He neither contested in elections nor did he hold any constitutional post during his days in Praja Rajyam Party. While
he actively campaigned for the party, he was also hit with few health problems. Kalyan was struck with bouts of vomiting, as he was hit by a
sunstroke during a roadshow at Vizag on 19 April 2009.[65] Later, in 2011, when Chiranjeevi merged his party[66] with the Congress Party,[67]
Kalyan took a break from political life, expressing his silent discontent with his brother's decision to merge the party.[68]
<br><br>
<strong>Jana Sena Party</strong><br>
Kalyan founded a political party named Jana Sena Party on 14 March 2014.[69] He wrote a book titled Ism which is also the ideology of the Jana Sena party.
[70] He met with then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to discuss the issues related to both the Telugu states and
 extended his support.[71] He campaigned extensively for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He opposed Congress
  party's rule stating the slogan Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao (lit. 'Stop Congress, Save the Country' in Hindi).[72] His rallies drew what the Deccan-Journal 
  called "huge crowds" in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.[73] In August 2017, he announced that he intended to enter full-time politics starting October 2017
   once he completes his film commitments.[74]

Kalyan brought the Uddanam kidney disease crisis to the attention of media and politicians through protests and a hunger strike. Government of Andhra Pradesh 
responded by constructing dialysis centers and implementing various schemes for the village.[75][76] In November 2016, Kalyan announced that Jana Sena will
 contest in the 2019 general elections in Andhra Pradesh.[77] He stated that he was planning to contest from all 175 legislatures of Andhra Pradesh without any
  alliance.[78] He opposed central government's move to privatise Dredging Corporation of India (DCI)[79] on a golden platter.[80] Kalyan led a protest march to
   condolence farmers who committed suicides or migrated from the drought-prone regions of Rayalaseema.[81] He opposed the TDP Government's decision on land pooling.
   [82] Kalyan conducted a march on the historical Dowleswaram Barrage in Rajahmundry demanding political accountability.[83] He exposed the alleged unchecked mining
    in the reserve forest area at Vanthada village of Prathipadu in East Godavari district.[84]

Kalyan has announced the Jana Sena party's 2019 election manifesto at Rajahmundry[85] public meeting with many measures to improve the lives of farmers,[86] farm labourers, women, youth, and students. His party would contest together with left parties[87] Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), and Bahujan Samaj Party[88] for the upcoming 2019 elections in both Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. At the same time, when he was actively campaigning for the elections all around Andhra Pradesh, he fell sick and shared a few health problems. As he was getting ready for his next round of campaign at Sattenapalle, he felt dizzy and nauseated. When the chopper was down for refilling at Gannavaram airport, he was down with vomiting, dehydration, and drowsiness. Immediately then, he was hospitalized and treated in Vijayawada. Again the campaign resumed after he got well.[89][90]

The Jana Sena Party has contested 140 constituencies in the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections. Kalyan has contested two constituencies – Gajuwaka[91] and Bhimavaram.[92] He has lost in both to candidates from YSR Congress Party.[93] His party was able to win from Razole, making it the only seat it has won in the election.[94]

Later the same year, on 3 November 2019, Kalyan led a long march in Visakhapatnam in support of construction workers against YSR Congress Party governance who have been facing unemployment due to shortage of supply of sand in Andhra Pradesh.[95]

On 16 January 2020, Kalyan has announced his party's alliance with BJP, after three years of distancing from it. Both the parties fought together in elections of 2024.[96] On 12 February 2020, he led a rally for justice to Sugali Preethi, a 15-year-old girl who was raped and murdered, in Kurnool.[97] He demanded an inquiry by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the incident.[98]

The Jana Sena Party contested 21 constituencies in the 2024 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, with Kalyan contesting in Pithapuram constituency. He won by a margin of more than 70,000 votes; Jana Sena Party won in all the contested twenty-one assembly constituencies and two Lok Sabha seats.[99]

On 12 June 2024 Kalyan was sworn in as a cabinet minister of Andhra Pradesh, whereas on 16 June 2024, he was announced as the deputy chief minister.[100]
